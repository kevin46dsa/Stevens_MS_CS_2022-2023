      <h1>That time i visited Washington DC</h1>
      <p>I took a trip to Washington DC with a few of my close friends. During the day, we went to many interesting places, the most memorable being the Whitehouse. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go inside the Whitehouse, but it felt great just to see it. This was a building that I've seen on television and the internet, but never in real life. So even though I couldn't go inside the Whitehouse, I still had a really fun time.</p>
      <p>However, we had to leave to go eat lunch. Usually, I love food and wouldn't ever miss a meal. But just this one time, I wanted to stay and skip lunch. Soon after the White House, We went to National Mueseum of Natural History which was really interesting to see the Bone Hall, in which there were masive skeletons of flying fish, a massive sea turtle, snakes, a giraffe, monkeys, and many more vertebrates. All in all, This trip will definately be a really memorable one. </p>
